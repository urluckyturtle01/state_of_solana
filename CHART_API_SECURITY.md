# Chart API Security Implementation

## Overview
Chart configuration data has been secured to prevent users from seeing sensitive information like API endpoints and keys in the browser console.

## What Was Changed

### 1. 🔒 Static Files Secured
- **Moved**: Chart config files from `/public/temp/chart-configs/` → `/server/chart-configs/`
- **Result**: Direct HTTP access to config files is now impossible

### 2. 🧹 API Endpoints Sanitized
Public API endpoints now return **sanitized** chart configurations:

#### Sanitized Public Endpoints:
- `/api/charts` - Lists all charts (sanitized)
- `/api/charts/list` - Chart list (sanitized)  
- `/api/charts/[id]` - Individual chart (sanitized)
- `/api/temp-configs/[pageId]` - Page configs (sanitized)

#### Sensitive Fields Removed:
- ❌ `apiEndpoint` - Internal API URLs
- ❌ `apiKey` - Authentication keys
- ❌ Other internal configuration

#### Safe Fields Preserved:
- ✅ `id`, `title`, `subtitle`
- ✅ `chartType`, `dataMapping`
- ✅ `displayOptions`, styling
- ✅ Layout and positioning data

### 3. 🔑 Admin-Only Endpoints
Full chart configurations with sensitive data are available through admin endpoints:

#### Admin Endpoints (Full Data):
- `/api/admin/charts` - All charts with full config
- `/api/admin/charts/[id]` - Individual chart with full config

#### Admin Authentication:
- Requests from `/admin/` pages
- `x-admin-auth` header (expandable)

## Before vs After

### 🚫 Before (Exposed):
```json
{
  "id": "chart_123",
  "title": "SOL Price",
  "apiEndpoint": "https://internal-api.topledger.xyz/sensitive-endpoint",
  "apiKey": "secret_key_123",
  "dataMapping": { ... }
}
```

### ✅ After (Sanitized):
```json
{
  "id": "chart_123", 
  "title": "SOL Price",
  "dataMapping": { ... },
  "sanitized": true
}
```

## Security Benefits

1. **🔒 No Direct File Access**: Chart configs not accessible via URLs
2. **🧹 Sanitized Public APIs**: Sensitive data filtered from public responses  
3. **🔑 Admin-Only Access**: Full configs only available to authenticated admins
4. **📱 Maintained Functionality**: Charts still render normally for users
5. **🛡️ Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of protection

## API Response Indicators

All responses now include a `sanitized` field:
- `"sanitized": true` - Data was filtered for public consumption
- `"sanitized": false` - Full data (admin access)
- `"adminAccess": true` - Accessed via admin endpoint

## Files Updated

### Core Security:
- `lib/chart-sanitizer.ts` - Sanitization logic
- `server/chart-configs/` - Moved chart files

### Public APIs (Sanitized):
- `app/api/charts/route.ts`
- `app/api/charts/list/route.ts`
- `app/api/charts/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/temp-configs/[pageId]/route.ts`

### Admin APIs (Full Access):
- `app/api/admin/charts/route.ts`
- `app/api/admin/charts/[id]/route.ts`

### Scripts & Docs:
- `public/temp/fetch-charts.js` - **Updated to use admin API**
- Various monitoring and SEO scripts

## Chart Generation Script

The `fetch-charts.js` script has been updated to:
- ✅ Use `/api/admin/charts` instead of `/api/charts`
- ✅ Include admin authentication headers
- ✅ Verify it receives full chart configurations
- ✅ Save complete chart configs with API endpoints

### Authentication:
```javascript
headers: {
  'x-admin-auth': 'chart-fetch-script',
  'User-Agent': 'fetch-charts-script/1.0'
}
```

## Testing

After deployment, verify:
1. ✅ Users cannot see `apiEndpoint` or `apiKey` in browser console
2. ✅ Charts still render and function normally
3. ✅ Admin pages can access full configurations
4. ✅ Direct file access returns 404

The chart system now provides the same functionality while keeping sensitive configuration data secure from public view.
